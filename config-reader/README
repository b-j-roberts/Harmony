** READ **
----------

This loads config settings designated in a passed file, can load all settings to be used (will load all as strings)
                                                        also could only load on call, this allows typing

** Notes **
-----------

This is the layout of a config file, and what it will load:

"Config.txt"
information: {

  cats: { sam, bethany, tony }

  dog: ruffis;

}

info: {
 
  time: 15:00:00;

}

If loading all: 


If loading by call:


Note : Spacing doesn't matter, only indicators like, '{', '}', ':', ';', ',' .
