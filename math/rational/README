--------------
Harmony/math/rational/rational.h
Harmony/math/rational/rational.cpp


** Ideas **
-----------
Add unsigned int version to increase number of possible numbers (this will decrease efficiency on
  adding and subtracting numbers of different & opposite signs respectively)

Add an arb int version


** Issues **
------------
Listed as TO DO on code


** Dependancies **
------------------
None


** Compiling **
---------------
If included in main.cpp:
  g++ -c main.cpp -std=c++1z -I ~/workspace
  g++ main.o -o main -L ~/workspace/Harmony/ -lharmony-math

i.e. C++17 & in Harmony's libharmony-math.a


** READ **
----------

This is a class for Rational number ( whos numerator and denominator are stored as int, but kept 
  positive after reduce() )

The number will be reduced after any calculation, so there is never worry of having an unreduced num


** Interface **
---------------

Construction :
  Rational() - sets value as 0 / 1
  Rational(numerator, denominator = 1) - sets value as numberator / denominator (default to 1)

operators allowed : ++ (pre and post), -- (pre and post) - these increment by 1
                    += , -=, *=, /=, +, -, *, /
                    ==, !=, <, <=, >, >=
                    <<
