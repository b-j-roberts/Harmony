** PROJECTS **
---------------

* Thread Pool - This is an implementation of a thread pool design structure using c++ thread objects.
                Currently not completed : Need to learn more about threading first
  *  thread-pool/threadQ.cpp - task queue implementation

* Argument Parser - This is a argument parser object (python-esk) that will allow general 
                      command line argument parsing
                    FUTURE : as_* function version, so no templates

** READ **
----------

* Thread Pool - How to use ?
    #include <thread_pool> ?
    ... explain how to use here ...

* Argument Parser - How to use ?
    #include <parser> ?
    ... explain how to use here ...


** Issues **
------------

The only known issue is that nothing is fully implemented yet


** Notes **
-----------

See file ./future_ideas for future ideas and things for this library
 
Note things I recommend, or think here ...

Note standard design patterns here (ie function name conventions, ... )
