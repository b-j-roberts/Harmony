** PROJECTS **
---------------

* Argument Parser - This is a argument parser object (python-esk) that will allow general 
                      command line argument parsing
                    Main object is : Parser
                    FUTURE : as_* function version, so no templates
  * arg_parser/template_version/arg_parser.h


* Config File Reader - This is a config file reader that is able to read config file info into
                         a map and then allow access to these config parameters in code
                       2 Main objects are : Config_Reader & Parameter


* Level Logger - This is a logger object that allows log levels, so that one can change the 
                   types of messages that get logged to an exterior file
                 Main object is : Logger
                 FUTURE : add stream constructor that allows the user to choose stream object
                   to write to ( so one can use cout stream and so on )


* Thread Pool - This is an implementation of a thread pool design structure using c++ thread objects.
                Currently not completed : Need to learn more about threading first
  *  thread-pool/threadQ.cpp - task queue implementation


NOTE : Each project has its own README that explains how to use and the implemetation 
       for the specific header files

** Issues **
------------

Issues in README's for specific projects
Search : TO\ DO for list of fixes and issues

Make into an actual library, rather than groups of header files

** Notes **
-----------

See file ./future_ideas for future ideas and things for this library
 
Note things I recommend, or think here ...

Note standard design patterns here (ie function name conventions, ... )
